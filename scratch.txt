# to bring up to team
1. Tract's population size between 1,200 and 8,000 according to census
2. We have 1000 tracts below and 4000 tracts above population size


# things to review
1. Dropping the lead paint column or not (currently not)
2. Drop 'vuleopct' - demographic index column
3. Dropping the 2000 'CANCER' (at index 73724 - Puerto Rico)
4. Inclusion of pwdis (waste discharge column) containing 20,000 missing values


# dropping pwdis - allude detailed information "to The water environmental indicator in previous versions of EJSCREEN was solely based on the number of
major NPDES facilities within a specific radius and took into account the distance the facilities are from
the centroid of a census block group. The indicator has no relationship to whether there is a discharge
of pollutants, nor what waterbody those are discharged into, or whether there is potential for exposure
to the discharged pollutants."
